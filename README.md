# GoogleAds_SearchQuery_NoneExcluded

When you exclude search queries day by day, it can be useful to have a daily stats None vs Excluded.

Script takes the data of the previous date and stores it in Google Spreadsheet.

It can help to understand if your exclusion really works (Q: Does the proportion of Excluded/None goes to zero?).
